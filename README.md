# Impact of Advertisement on Sales Using Linear Regression

## Overview

This project explores the impact of advertising efforts on sales by employing Linear Regression. The goal is to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales figures, providing insights into the effectiveness of marketing strategies.We also have a sales prediction app that computes sales based on users input to TV,Radio and Newspaper budget.

## Features

### Data Collection

- Gather data on advertising spending across different channels (e.g., TV, radio, online) and corresponding sales figures.
- Explore and clean the dataset to ensure its suitability for analysis.

### Model Building

- Utilize Linear Regression to create a predictive model.
- Identify key features (advertising spending) and the target variable (sales) to train the model.

### Training and Evaluation

- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Train the Linear Regression model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set.

### Visualization

- Visualize the linear relationship between advertising spending and sales using graphs or charts.
- Provide insights into the impact of each advertising channel on overall sales.

### Predictions

- Use the trained model to make predictions on new data, forecasting potential sales based on different advertising budgets.
